 ### Adding this plugin in your local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD
 
-Modify the text file under `/nomad/default_plugins.txt` and add:
-```sh
-<other-content-in-default_plugins.txt>
-nomad-plugin-mbe==x.y.z
-```
-where `x.y.z` represents the released version of this plugin.
-
-Then, go to your NOMAD folder, activate your NOMAD virtual environment and run:
-```sh
-deactivate
-cd <route-to-NOMAD-folder>/nomad
-source .pyenv/bin/activate
-./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
-```
-
-Alternatively and only valid for your local NOMAD installation, you can modify `nomad.yaml` to include this plugin, see [NOMAD Oasis - Install plugins](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html).

-### Build the python package
-
-The `pyproject.toml` file contains everything that is necessary to turn the project
-into a pip installable python package. Run the python build tool to create a package distribution:
-
-```sh
-pip install build
-python -m build --sdist
-```
-
-You can install the package with pip:
-
-```sh
-pip install dist/nomad-plugin-mbe-0.1.0
-```
-
-Read more about python packages, `pyproject.toml`, and how to upload packages to PyPI
-on the [PyPI documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
-
+We now recommend using the dedicated [`nomad-distro-dev`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev) repository to simplify the process. Please refer to that repository for detailed instructions.
